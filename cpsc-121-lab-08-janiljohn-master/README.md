# CPSC 121
# Fancy Stuff with Classes

## Objective
* Use your knowledge of loops, conditions, and variables
* Learn to use the `make` command
* Exposure to object oriented programming

# Instructions
Write a program for each exercise sub-directory. Each exercise subdirectory is prefixed with the string `part-`.

Every file that you submit must have a header. Change the comment line (the one starting with ```//```) to state your full name. On the next line, start a new comment and state which section of CPSC 120 you are enrolled in. On the next line, start a new comment and state today's date. On the next line, start a new comment and state your CSUF email address. On the next line, start a new command and provide a short description of the program you are writing. For example, if your name is Tuffy Titan and you are in CPSC 120-01, the comment may look something like
  ```
  // Tuffy Titan
  // CPSC 121-01
  // 2050-01-01
  // tuffy.titan@csu.fullerton.edu
  //
  // This my first program and it prints out Hello World!
  ```

Please adhere to the [Google C++ coding style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

When writing git log comments, please make them descriptive and meaningful.

# Rubric
Each exercise is worth 10 points. There is a total of 10 points possible. Your program must compile, in other words be syntactically correct, before it is graded. Submissions that do not compile shall be assigned a zero grade. 

For each problem:

* Functionality (6 points): Your submission shall be assessed for the appropriate constructs and strategies to address the exercise.

* Compilation (2 point): Your submission shall compile with no warnings. Compile with errors results in a zero grade.

* Readability (2 point): Your submission shall be assessed by checking whether your code passess the style and format check, as well as how well it follows the proper naming conventions, and internal documentation guidelines. Git log messages are an integral part of how readable your project is.
